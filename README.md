## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Configuration

1. Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Firestore Database and Authentication
3. Get your Firebase configuration from Project Settings > General > Your apps
4. Update `.env` file with your Firebase credentials:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### 2. Installation & Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Build for Production

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```
